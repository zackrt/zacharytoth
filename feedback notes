In the LA area, it’s highly competitive to land interviews, so I would like you to work on the design a bit more. To be very direct with you, this portfolio does not look professional as it is now.  The background image and gradients clash, the images are blurry, the text is too large, and the buttons are unstyled and use inconsistent capitalization. It all looks very rushed. Why not replicate the style from your template website using your own CSS? I’ll also send you some example portfolios and “design for developers” resources
